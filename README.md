# Animal Rewind

App for Gemini AI Competition.

Animal Rewind is an app that allows you to converse with six fascinating extinct animals: the Dodo, Thylacine, Quagga, Passenger Pigeon, Giant Tortoise and Bucardo.

Each conversation is a unique experience, where users can learn about the habitat, the reasons for extinction and how we can prevent other species from suffering the same fate.

Through these conversations, users are inspired to reflect on the human impact on nature.

Animal Rewind is not only an educational tool, but also a call to action. Knowing the past helps us protect the future.
